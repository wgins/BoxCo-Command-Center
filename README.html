BoxCo. Command Center
Powered by Twilio
Will Ginsberg

These files are used to create a "command center" for a student-run storage company,BoxCo. 
Together, the files create the following functionality:
1)Allows customers to BoxCo and hear a menu and connect to a manager. 
2)Allows employees/managers to make outgoing calls from their cellphones by either calling the BoxCo number and entering a pin, or using the outgoingcall webpage.
3)Allows employees/managers to send mass texts
4)Queries a database of customers, determines pickup time for their packagers, and sends a text 30 minutes before pickup time to alert them that someone will be at their residence. This is done through a cronjob.
5)Allows managers to set the manager on duty number

Below are instructions made for managers to help better understand how the system works and best practices. 

------------------

1.	Incoming Call 
	a.	BoxCo. Phone Number – (999) 999 - 9999
	b.	On incoming call:
		i.	Caller is greeted (helloBoxCo.php)
			1.	If the caller presses 1, it redirects to manager on duty. The manager on duty is set through: 					phoneMagicBoxCo.
			2.	If the caller presses 2, it says “To hear more info, press 2.” This then tells them for more 					information to visit nuboxco.com
			3.	If a BoxCo. team member presses XXXXXX, they will be entered into the outgoing call center. Once 				you press XXXXX, the system will prompt you to enter a phone number. The phone number will then 					be dialed. (NOTE: If you use this method of outgoing call, the callerID will display YOUR 				PERSONAL NUMBER on their phone, not the BoxCo. phone number.)
			4.	If the caller presses 3, it disconnects. 
	c.	TECHNICAL INFORMATION:
		i.	To change actions of the phone menu, pin for outgoing call, or general edits, change the input handler 				document. 
		ii.	To change the numbers in Phone Magic you must edit the php file: /phonemagicBoxCo.php. If you want to 				add or remove users, open the file and simply add the number to the dropdown menu.

------------------

2.	Incoming Text
	a.If a customer texts the BoxCo. number, it automatically replies with the following message:
		i.	“Thank you for contacting BoxCo. Please email us at contact@nuboxco.com with any questions or concerns. 			Thanks!”
	b.	TECHNICAL INFORMATION:
		i.	To modify this text, edit: /boxcoSMSReply.php

------------------

3.	Send Text to Customer:
	a.	TECHNICAL INFORMATION:
		i.	This is all run through a php file: /boxcoTextCustomer.php 
		ii.	This runs automatically and requires no manipulation other than edits to how it operates in general.
		iii.	It queries the database to join xxxx and xxxxxx to find when the customer name, delivery date, and delivery time, and whether a text has been sent to them or not.
		iv.	Once the text has been sent, it updates the column “xxxxxxx” to a 1. A 0 indicates text has not been sent, a 1 indicates that a text HAS been sent. 
		v.	The php file looks at the current time, looks at the scheduled delivery time, then sends a text 30 minutes before scheduled delivery time. Example: If delivery time is 11am or 11:30am, a text is sent a 				10:35am.
		vi.	The file will not send a text unless it is between 6am and 6pm.  This is because the file reads in first two numbers in the string “delivery_time” and cannot differentiate between 11am and 11pm, so to 				combat this problem all  potential repeat times have been eliminated. (This is sort of confusing, and 				better explained in person. It should never be a problem unless delivery times move late into the 				evening.)
		vii.	There is a cron job setup in the server to run this php file every day in june,  everyday of the week, 			every hour on the 5th and 35th minute. To change the cron job:
			1.	SSH
				a.	Ssh USER
				b.	Pw: PASSWORD
			2.	execute command: crontab –e
			3.	edit the file in vim or whatever editor you are using
			4.	WARNING: IF YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING, DON’T DO IT!!!!!!!!

------------------

4.	Send Text to Employee or General Mass Text from BoxCo Number
	a.	To send a mass text:
		i.	Open the file /boxcoMassText.php in an editor of your choice
		ii.	Modify the $people array, by adding a list of numbers separated by commas in the format shown below
		iii.	Modify the sms body to your liking:
		iv.	Save file to server, then open mass text link
		v.	Enter the PIN: XXXXXXXX
		vi.	Click, “Send Mass Text!”
		vii.	Once you have done so, it is STRONGLY recommended you delete the array of numbers and re-save so that 				you do not accidentally re-send the same text to that array again.

------------------

5.	Make Outgoing Call from BoxCo. Number
	a.	To make an outgoing call from the BoxCo. phone number, go to start call page:
		i.	There are instructions at the top of the page, however:
			1.	Enter the pin: XXXXXXX
			2.	Enter the phone number you want to call in format: 1XXXYYYZZZZ
			3.	Select YOUR name.
				a.	You want to select your name because the way this works is that the system calls you, 						then connects you to the customer that you want to call. 
			4.	Click “Call!
				a.	You should receive a call from the BoxCo. number, 9999999999, and you will hear that you 				are then being connected to the customer.
